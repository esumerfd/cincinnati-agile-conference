                      Taking a team and introducing Agile is fun, in a pulling teeth kind of way.

We are not perfect but we are better every day.

                      How are your software estimation skills? If your answer was "Dude, I'm terrible at estimation", you're not alone. Being able to accurately estimate software is a skill every developer should have but research and statistics show it's a skill few actually possess. In this session, we'll talk about why we have so much trouble with this key skill and then discuss some strategies for improving our software estimation chops.

                      <h6>"Why Agile Fails"</h6>    
                      So you are ready to try something new, ready to take on what appears to be an improvement in the processes you use today. How many projects fail to change their organizations the first time? What can you do to prepare for the change and what signs should you be looking for along the way. Let's explore failure before it happens.

                      <h6>"Being Agile in the Waterfall Sandbox"</h6>
                      Scrum and XP have found a strong following in the development community.  But most non-development groups (such as Web Administrators, Production Support, Security, Testing, and Users/Stake Holders) inside the enterprise are far from agile, nor are they trying to move to be more agile. This session uses real experiences from large enterprise development projects to show how to effectively work with those teams.  Instead of trying to "convert" them, we discuss strategies to adapt to their needs while remaining agile in the development realm.

                    <h6>"Agile Budgeting"</h6>
                    How do agile projects accurately forecast their budget when they are typically just a bunch of hippies coding without requirements or documentation? Waterfall projects are obviously much better at budgeting with all of the traditional up front design and planning, right? Anyone who has been on a waterfall project can see that this is a complete fallacy. Good agile projects are typically very accurate with regards to budgeting. This session will explore some budgeting techniques for agile projects including leveraging a Sprint 0, developing Value Stories, and using technical Spikes. We'll cover these topics with interactive examples and also identify where we think the industry needs to go with budgeting on agile projects.

                    <h6>"Smoothing Process Potholes with Retrospectives"</h6>
                    Friction in your process or environment takes away from your ability to do what you and your team do best: deliver value to your project's stakeholders. Retrospectives, recurring meetings focused on improving your process, are a great way for your team to identify what's causing your team friction as well as calling out good things you need to do more of. This session introduces retrospectives and walks you through the steps of implementing them. We'll cover tips and tricks to getting them done right, and discuss some common pitfalls. You'll leave this session with insight on a simple, yet incredibly powerful tool to drastically improve your team's collaboration and ability to deliver great value.
