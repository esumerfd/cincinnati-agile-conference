   <h3>What is Cincinnati Day of Agile?</h3>
    <p>
      As the Agile project management process sweeps across the
      software industry, businesses not understanding the details are
      being left behind. This 3rd Cincinnati Day of Agile builds on the
      successful events last year to present a 3 track conference to
      both introduce those new to Agile and encourage stimulating
      conversation for those more advanced in the subject.

    <p>
      At this one day event on Saturday, Mar 26th, you will have the 
      opportunity to choose between 3 different tracks. The first is
      focused on those new to Agile, the second aims to bring together
      the latest in Agile thinking for the advanced practitioner and the
      third track, run as an open space, aims to help those with specific
      problems looking for groups of experts to discuss.
