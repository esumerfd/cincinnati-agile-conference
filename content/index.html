    <h3>What is Cincinnati Day of Agile?</h3>
    <p>
      As the Agile project management process sweeps across the
      software industry, businesses not understanding the details are
      being left behind. The Cincinnati Day of Agile is an opportunity
      to understand what Agile is all about and hear from people that
      have used it, succeeded with it and have the results to prove
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this one day event on Saturday, May 15th, a host of industry
      experts will be on hand to offer their hard won experiences. By
      bringing together a mix of developers, managers, Agile
      professionals, and technologists, the Cincinnati Day of Agile
      also provides excellent networking opportunities for its
      attendees. We hope you will join us to learn how Agile can make
      your software development process more effective, productive,
      and profitable.

        <p>
          Mark Windholtz first encountered ExtremeProgramming in 1999
          and immediately added Agile practices to his development
          process to get software projects done better and
          faster. Through his company, AgileDNA LLC, he has advised
          Agile teams for Commercial, Non-Profit, Start-up, and

        <h6>"Agile Flavors"</h6>
        <p>
          The term "Agile" includes a number of software processes and
          frameworks. This talk will introduce at a high-level, what
          Agile is and the major varieties of Agile.
        </p>

        <h6>"Business Practices"</h6>
        <p>
          While the technical team is keeping things moving smoothly
          along, the business part of the team also has work to do.
          This talk will cover those practices.

        <p>

        </p>

        <h6>"Agile Success Story"</h6>    
        <p>
          Taking a team and introducing Agile is fun, in a pulling
          teeth kind of way. Over many months, and during a critical
          project, our team transformed from an effective group of
          skilled engineers to an effective group of skilled engineers
          that produced the right business functionality at the right
          time. We are not perfect but we are better every day.

        </p>

        <h6>"Engineering Practices"</h6>
        <p>
          The three most important things for an agile development
          team are: feedback, feedback and feedback.  This feedback
          allows an agile team to respond quickly to changes while
          maintaining a high level of quality.  In order to achieve
          this level of feedback, the team follows a disciplined set
          of agile practices.  This talk will focus on the engineering
          practices and demonstrate how they work together.

        <h6>"Estimation"</h6>
        <p> How are your software estimation skills? If your answer
          was "Dude, I'm terrible at estimation", you're not
          alone. Being able to accurately estimate software is a skill
          every developer should have but research and statistics show
          it's a skill few actually possess. In this session, we'll
          talk about why we have so much trouble with this key skill
          and then discuss some strategies for improving our software
          estimation chops.

        <h6>"2 Things to do tomorrow to be more agile"</h6>
        <p>
          Becoming more agile is a journey, not a destination. The
          first few steps on that journey can be challenging. You have
          to start changing your culture, but where? We will look at
          two simple things you can start doing the next day to start
          to turn the battleship.

        <h6>"Why Agile Fails"</h6>    
        <p>
          So you are ready to try something new, ready to take on what
          appears to be an improvement in the processes you use
          today. How many projects fail to change their organizations
          the first time? What can you do to prepare for the change
          and what signs should you be looking for along the
          way. Let's explore failure before it happens.

        <h6>"Being Agile in the Waterfall Sandbox"</h6>
        <p>
          Scrum and XP have found a strong following in the
          development community.  But most non-development groups
          (such as Web Administrators, Production Support, Security,
          Testing, and Users/Stake Holders) inside the enterprise are
          far from agile, nor are they trying to move to be more
          agile. This session uses real experiences from large
          enterprise development projects to show how to effectively
          work with those teams.  Instead of trying to "convert" them,
          we discuss strategies to adapt to their needs while
          remaining agile in the development realm.

          the impact of productivity by enforcing those proven
          concepts and training.

        <h6>"Agile Budgeting"</h6>
        <p>
          How do agile projects accurately forecast their budget when
          they are typically just a bunch of hippies coding without
          requirements or documentation? Waterfall projects are
          obviously much better at budgeting with all of the
          traditional up front design and planning, right? Anyone who
          has been on a waterfall project can see that this is a
          complete fallacy. Good agile projects are typically very
          accurate with regards to budgeting. This session will
          explore some budgeting techniques for agile projects
          including leveraging a Sprint 0, developing Value Stories,
          and using technical Spikes. We'll cover these topics with
          interactive examples and also identify where we think the
          industry needs to go with budgeting on agile projects.
