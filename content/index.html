    <h3>What is Cincinnati Day of Agile?</h3>
    <p>
      As the Agile project management process sweeps across the
      software industry, businesses not understanding the details are
      being left behind. This 3rd Cincinnati Day of Agile builds on the
      successful events last year to present a 3 track conference to
      both introduce those new to Agile and encourage stimulating
      conversation for those more advanced in the subject.
   </p>
    <p>
      At this one day event on Saturday, Mar 26th, you will have the 
      opportunity to choose between 3 different tracks. The first is
      focused on those new to Agile, the second aims to bring together
      the latest in Agile thinking for the advanced practitioner and the
      third track, run as an open space, aims to help those with specific
      problems looking for groups of experts to discuss.

        <h6>"Intro to Scrum/Agile"</h6>
        <p>
          The term "Agile" includes a number of software processes and
          frameworks. This talk will introduce at a high-level, what
          Agile is and the major varieties of Agile.
          While the technical team is keeping things moving smoothly
          along, the business part of the team also has work to do.
          This talk will cover those practices.

        <h6>"Engineering Practices"</h6>
        <p>
          The three most important things for an agile development
          team are: feedback, feedback and feedback.  This feedback
          allows an agile team to respond quickly to changes while
          maintaining a high level of quality.  In order to achieve
          this level of feedback, the team follows a disciplined set
          of agile practices.  This talk will focus on the engineering
          practices and demonstrate how they work together.

        <h6>"Five Things to Be More Agile"</h6>
        <p>
          Becoming more agile is a journey, not a destination. The
          first few steps on that journey can be challenging. You have
          to start changing your culture, but where? We will look at
          two simple things you can start doing the next day to start
          to turn the battleship.

        <h6>"Why Agile Fails"</h6>    
        <p>
          So you are ready to try something new, ready to take on what
          appears to be an improvement in the processes you use
          today. How many projects fail to change their organizations
          the first time? What can you do to prepare for the change
          and what signs should you be looking for along the
          way. Let's explore failure before it happens.

        <h6>"A Business Success Story"</h6>    
        <p>
        How do you bring a project back from disaster?  Go Agile!  If your failing project suffers from constant requirements changes, high defect rates, and never-ending regression cycles, agile is your savior (if done correctly).   This talk will outline a real life example, from a Fortune 25 company, of how transitioning to agile turned a failing project into a celebration at the weekly board of directors meeting.

        <h6>"Enterprise Agility"</h6>
        <p>
          Scrum and XP have found a strong following in the
          development community.  But most non-development groups
          (such as Web Administrators, Production Support, Security,
          Testing, and Users/Stake Holders) inside the enterprise are
          far from agile, nor are they trying to move to be more
          agile. This session uses real experiences from large
          enterprise development projects to show how to effectively
          work with those teams.  Instead of trying to "convert" them,
          we discuss strategies to adapt to their needs while
          remaining agile in the development realm.
