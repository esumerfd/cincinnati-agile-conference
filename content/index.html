    <h3>What is Cincinnati Day of Agile?</h3>
    <p>
      As the Agile project management process sweeps across the
      software industry, businesses not understanding the details are
      being left behind. The 2nd Cincinnati Day of Agile is another opportunity
      to understand what Agile is all about and hear from people that
      have used it, succeeded with it and have the results to prove
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this one day event on Saturday, Aug 14th, a host of industry
      experts will be on hand to offer their hard won experiences. By
      bringing together a mix of developers, managers, Agile
      professionals, and technologists, the Cincinnati Day of Agile
      also provides excellent networking opportunities for its
      attendees. We hope you will join us to learn how Agile can make
      your software development process more effective, productive,
      and profitable.

      <div class="bios">
        <p>
          Mark Windholtz first encountered ExtremeProgramming in 1999
          and immediately added Agile practices to his development
          process to get software projects done better and
          faster. Through his company, AgileDNA LLC, he has advised
          Agile teams for Commercial, Non-Profit, Start-up, and
          Defense projects. Major clients include the AgileAlliance,
          and the ScrumAlliance. As the founder of the Cincinnati
          Agile Roundtable, Mark has be instrumental in promoting the

        </p>

        <h6>"Agile Flavors"</h6>
        <p>
          The term "Agile" includes a number of software processes and
          frameworks. This talk will introduce at a high-level, what
          Agile is and the major varieties of Agile.
          While the technical team is keeping things moving smoothly
          along, the business part of the team also has work to do.
          This talk will cover those practices.

      <h5>Jim Weirich</h5>
      <div class="bios">

          Jim Weirich is the Chief Scientist for EdgeCase LLC, a Rails
          development firm located in Columbus Ohio. Jim has over
          twenty-five years of experience in software development. He

        </p>

        <h6>"Engineering Practices"</h6>
        <p>
          The three most important things for an agile development
          team are: feedback, feedback and feedback.  This feedback
          allows an agile team to respond quickly to changes while
          maintaining a high level of quality.  In order to achieve
          this level of feedback, the team follows a disciplined set
          of agile practices.  This talk will focus on the engineering
          practices and demonstrate how they work together.

      <h5>Brian Prince</h5>
      <div class="bios">
        <p>
          Brian H. Prince is an Architect Evangelist for Microsoft. He
          gets super excited whenever he talks about technology,
          especially cloud computing, patterns, and practices. His job

          and help them bring their architecture to a super level. In
          a past life Brian was a part of super startups, super eting
          firms, and super consulting firms. Much of his super
          architecture background includes building super scalable
          applications, application integration, and award winning web
          applications. All of them were super. Further, he is a
          co-founder of the non-profit organization CodeMash
          (www.codemash.org). He speaks at various regional and
          national technology events including TechEd. He only wishes
          his job didn't require him to say "super" so much. Brian
          holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science and
          Physics from Capital University, Columbus, Ohio. He is also
          a zealous gamer. For example, he is a huge fan of Fallout 3.

        <h6>"5 Things to do tomorrow to be more agile"</h6>
        <p>
          Becoming more agile is a journey, not a destination. The
          first few steps on that journey can be challenging. You have
          to start changing your culture, but where? We will look at
          two simple things you can start doing the next day to start
          to turn the battleship.

        <h6>"Why Agile Fails"</h6>    
        <p>
          So you are ready to try something new, ready to take on what
          appears to be an improvement in the processes you use
          today. How many projects fail to change their organizations
          the first time? What can you do to prepare for the change
          and what signs should you be looking for along the
          way. Let's explore failure before it happens.

        <h6>"Being Agile in the Waterfall Sandbox"</h6>
        <p>
          Scrum and XP have found a strong following in the
          development community.  But most non-development groups
          (such as Web Administrators, Production Support, Security,
          Testing, and Users/Stake Holders) inside the enterprise are
          far from agile, nor are they trying to move to be more
          agile. This session uses real experiences from large
          enterprise development projects to show how to effectively
          work with those teams.  Instead of trying to "convert" them,
          we discuss strategies to adapt to their needs while
          remaining agile in the development realm.
